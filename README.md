# Inspector_Application
Inspector is a grading application that will be used by Lecturers in the University of Limerick. 
The main aim of this final year project is to increase the turn-around time in the grading process for lecturers.
This application will focus on the speed at which assignments can be graded. This will be achieved using pre-programmed
keys on the computer which will represent grades and also keys which will allow the lecturer to access main menu and 
other features in the application.
